            <h1>Reducing Waste and Enabling Innovation</h1>

            <p>The small things we do can have a big impact on our world.

                Taking the decision to start removing plastic straws from our Starbucks stores is a small but important step on our journey to be more environmentally conscious, to lessen our impact on the world around us, reduce the amount of waste we produce and reach our goal of being resource positive here in the MENA region. 
                
                This journey began in July 2018 when globally Starbucks announced that plastic straws would be phased out and a transition towards using only paper straws would get underway. Now, we’ve gone one step further and started to remove the need for straws altogether through the introduction of our new strawless lids for our cold beverages range.
                
                Through a combination of great design, innovative thinking and a focus on finding a better, greener solution, the fully recyclable strawless lid was born.  The arrival of the strawless lid in the MENA region represents a leap forward in eco-friendly thinking and problem solving. Proof that small changes really can have a big impact.</p>
